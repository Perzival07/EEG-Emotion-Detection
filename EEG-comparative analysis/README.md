# DEAP EEG Emotion Recognition -- Comparative Analysis

Subject-independent emotion classification on the DEAP dataset: a classical-ML
pipeline on Differential Entropy features (Track A) vs. a deep-learning
pipeline on raw EEG windows (Track B), plus an eighteen-section investigation
into why subject-independent performance is weak, and a cross-corpus
validation against SEED-IV. See `Project_Report.pdf` / `Project_Report.tex`
for the full write-up.

## Datasets (not included in this repo)

The raw EEG datasets are large (multi-GB) and gated/licensed, so they are
**not committed to Git** (`deap-dataset/`, `seed-dataset/`, and the derived
`processed_cache/` are gitignored). Download them yourself and place them at
the paths below.

| Dataset | Link | Place at |
|---|---|---|
| DEAP (preprocessed Python `.dat` files, Kaggle mirror -- what this project actually used) | <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manh123df/deap-dataset> | `deap-dataset/data_preprocessed_python/` |
| DEAP (official source; registration/EULA required -- currently returning HTTP 503, verify before relying on it) | <https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/> | `deap-dataset/data_preprocessed_python/` |
| SEED-IV (Kaggle mirror, no agreement required) | <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phhasian0710/seed-iv> | `seed-dataset/` |
| SEED (original, 3-class) -- not used here | requires a signed BCMI data-use agreement | -- |
| DREAMER -- not used here | <https://zenodo.org/records/546113> (access-request form on the record page) | -- |
| AMIGOS -- not used here | <https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/amigos/> (currently returning HTTP 503, verify before relying on it) | -- |

`processed_cache/` (cached `.npz` feature/window builds) is regenerated
automatically the first time the relevant notebook cell or script runs against
the raw data -- expect several minutes on a cache miss.
